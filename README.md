# HashSet-Project
## Introduction
I implement a simple hashset by LinkedList in JAVA. The user can implement adding (including rehashing process) and deleting elements to the hash set according to the instructions on the terminal.

## Programming techniques used on this project
JAVA Object-Oriented Programming, Hashing, LinkedList

## How to play with this project
When users open the terminal, compile the java file, and then run the 'test'. They can type "ADD", "DELETE", "SHOW" OR "EXIT" to interact with the program.

### Rehashing
When a user adds a certain amount of data to the hash set, the hash set will rehash to reduce the time complexity of subsequent addition, deletion, search and other functions.
